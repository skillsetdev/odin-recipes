    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Yakamein might be the best noodle soup you’ve never heard of (which is
      very unusual for a recipe from New Orleans). Classic dishes from The Big
      Easy are known and loved all over the world, but Yakamein is more of a
      local secret. I don’t think it’s intentional, since I’ve been to New
      Orleans and the folks down there really want you to know about and enjoy
      all their food — but for whatever reason, it’s just not popular outside of
      Louisiana. Hopefully, this video helps change that — at least for you.

      Besides being an incredibly delicious thing to eat, this simple soup is
      supposed to be an effective hangover cure, which explains its nickname,
      “Old Sober.” Although, I’ve never tested its effectiveness since I haven’t
      had a really bad hangover in a very long time. In fact, I think the last
      one was in New Orleans. I don’t recommend starting an evening there with
      three Sazeracs. Ouch. Anyway, whether you use it to cure a hangover, or
      you just want a big, beautiful, steaming bowl of noodle soup, I really do
      hope you give this a try soon. Enjoy!

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 1/2 pounds beef chuck roast, cut into 1-inch pieces</li>

      <li>1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt</li>

      <li>1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>

      <li>1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper, or to taste</li>

      <li>1/2 teaspoon paprika</li>

      <li>2 tablespoons avocado oil or vegetable oil</li>

      <li>1 cup chopped yellow onion</li>

      <li>1/2 cup diced celery</li>

      <li>1/2 cup diced green pepper</li>

      <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>

      <li>2 tablespoons soy sauce</li>

      <li>1 1/2 teaspoons Worcestershire sauce</li>

      <li>1 1/2 teaspoons granulated garlic</li>

      <li>8 cups water</li>

      <li>2 tablespoons beef bouillon paste</li>

      <li>12 ounces dry spaghetti</li>

      <li>4 large hard boiled eggs, peeled and halved</li>

      <li>1 cup sliced green onions</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Place beef pieces into a bowl and add salt, black pepper, cayenne
        pepper, and paprika. Toss very thoroughly until meat is evenly coated.
        Let sit at room temperature for about 20 minutes before browning, or
        place in the fridge until needed.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add oil to a heavy-bottomed pot, and heat on high until oil is
        shimmering. Add beef in a single layer, and sear until a nice brown
        crust forms, 3 to 5 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Turn beef over, and let other side cook about 2 minutes. The second side
        will not brown like the first, but that’s okay. Turn heat down to
        medium-high; remove beef to a bowl and set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add onions, celery, peppers, and minced garlic to the pot, and cook,
        stirring, until onions begin to turn translucent, 3 to 5 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add beef back in along with any accumulated juices. Add soy sauce,
        Worcestershire sauce, granulated garlic, water, and beef bouillon paste.
        Stir and wait for soup to come to a simmer. Lower heat to medium-low and
        simmer until the meat is very tender, 60 to 90 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Before serving, taste and adjust with more salt or soy if needed. Keep
        soup on low heat until ready to serve.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in
        the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender, about 12
        minutes. Drain, and divide evenly between 4 large soup bowls.
      </li>
      <h3>Chef's Noodle Notes</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          If preparing noodles ahead of time, cook until tender, drain, and
          rinse under cold water. Drain well, and toss noodles with a little
          vegetable oil to prevent sticking. Noodles can be held at room
          temperature until soup is ready.
        </li>
        <li>
          Reheat refrigerated noodles in the microwave for 1 minute, or add to a
          mesh strainer and dunk into hot soup, then divide into serving bowls.
        </li>
        <li>
          Cooked noodles can be added directly to the finished soup to reheat,
          but then even portioning is much harder.
        </li>
        <p></p>
      </ul>
      <li>
        Ladle hot soup over noodles, and garnish each bowl with a hardboiled
        egg, hot sauce, and sliced green onions.
      </li>
    </ol>
