    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Italian braised beef and potatoes is one of my favorite dishes of all
      time. If you crave meat and potatoes, this is the ultimate in simple,
      rustic, and comforting. I'm using beef shank, because it's one of the
      toughest cuts of beef, and the tough cuts really do braise the best.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>2 teaspoons kosher salt</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
      <li>1/8 teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons olive oil, divided</li>
      <li>
        3 pounds beef shank, cut into thick cross sections (osso buco-style)
      </li>
      <li>1 large yellow onion, diced</li>
      <li>1 cup chopped celery</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons tomato paste</li>
      <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon dried rosemary, or 2 teaspoons minced fresh rosemary</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon dried marjoram or oregano</li>
      <li>1/2 cup white wine</li>
      <li>2 cups beef broth or chicken broth</li>
      <li>1 bay leaf</li>
      <li>2 pounds Yukon gold potatoes, peeled and cut into 2-inch chunks</li>
      <li>1/2 cup water</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon chopped Italian parsley (optional)</li>
      <li>1 fresh lemon, cut into wedges</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).</li>
      <li>
        Mix salt, black pepper, and cayenne together in a small bowl, and
        generously season both sides of beef. Reserve remaining seasoning mix to
        use later in the recipe.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat olive oil in a Dutch oven over high heat; add beef to the pot and
        cook, turning occasionally, until browned on both sides. Remove beef to
        a plate; set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Reduce heat to medium. Add onion and celery to the pot with a large
        pinch of seasoning. Cook, stirring, until onions begin to turn
        translucent, 3 to 5 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stir in tomato paste, garlic, and dried herbs, and cook for 1 to 2
        minutes. Stir in wine, and cook for a few minutes until most of the wine
        has disappeared.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add broth and bay leaf, and turn heat to high to bring the pot back to a
        simmer. Add beef back in; baste with some of the cooking liquid.
      </li>
      <li>
        Roast, covered, in the preheated oven until meat is almost fork tender,
        but not falling off the bone, about 2 hours.
      </li>
      <li>
        Drizzle potato pieces with olive oil, and sprinkle with a big pinch of
        the seasoning mix, or just some salt. Spoon a few tablespoons of beef
        fat from the top of the braising liquid over the potatoes, and mix well.
      </li>
      <li>
        Transfer potatoes in and around beef. Rinse the bowl with about 1/2 cup
        water and add to the pot.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cover; roast at 325 degrees F (165 degrees C) until meat and potatoes
        are very tender, about 1 hour more.
      </li>
      <li>
        Serve in a bowl with cooking liquids spooned over. Sprinkle with parsley
        and chili flakes and serve with fresh lemon wedges.
      </li>
    </ol>
